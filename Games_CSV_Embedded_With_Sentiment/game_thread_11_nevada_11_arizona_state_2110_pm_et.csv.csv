Alford in my eyes has done a wonderful job this season. If Nevada loses those three games early in the season, is the reception any different?

I’m not happy with how they finished, make no mistake, and I think coaching absolutely plays a role in it. But for me to write off Alford and this team, I just feel like that’s silly.
