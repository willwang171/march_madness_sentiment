"It’s a travesty that Mike Woodson only got to develop TJD for 2 years.

Imagine what he could’ve become with all 4 under Woody. He was good under Archie don’t get me wrong, but man what wasted development time. Woody has turned him from a very good player into a legitimate star.",djrob0,2023-03-18 02:56:27
TJD is the best player in the country and it’s been obvious to anyone with eyes for a month. The other guy can’t defend or pass and just went the last like 10 minutes of a close game against a team of pigmy’s without taking a shot.,MonacledMarlin,2023-03-18 03:32:29

Can’t get any fucking better than Purdue making history as losers and Indiana winning. It may be a perfect day,average_elite,2023-03-18 04:45:18
I got love for the IU Hoosiers since they’re on the complete opposite side of the bracket. I’m rooting for them currently. If we both make the final four i will have to rescind this: Hoosier daddy is a pretty cool phrase. Sparty on is cool but Hoosier daddy? You can’t beat that,Asap_roc,2023-03-18 03:45:02
TJD looked back at him and then dunked on him 😂,TheRealHenryG,2023-03-18 04:23:46

They’re really trying to make sure every IU fan is asleep or blacked out by the end of the game.,chiefmud,2023-03-18 02:32:43
