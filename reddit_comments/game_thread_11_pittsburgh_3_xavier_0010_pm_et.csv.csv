"How the end of this game plays may well be decided on how Pitt comes out of the half. Xavier played extraordinary offense most of the half but down 14 is in no way a death knell. A couple threes and this is a very different game. On another note though, Xavier team offense looked so delicious this half that I had to keep reminding myself that I don’t like them.
