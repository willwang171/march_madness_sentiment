"I don't disagree, and by all means I wouldn't trade Self for any other coach in college basketball...  But...  I've always felt this is his biggest flaw (IMHO).  Self chooses his starters + 1 or 2 primary bench guys before the season starts, and if you aren't in that group you have ZERO leash.  You go in and make 1 mistake you likely won't see the court for 3 or 4 games.  That doesn't give guys like Clemence any time to build confidence.  Why we always struggle with bench productivity, and why guys like Udeh are slow to come along.  That being said, it obviously works out for Self more often than not so what do I know.",DejectedExec,2023-03-16 20:48:28
