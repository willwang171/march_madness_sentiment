"They are lol. Go look at them the last two years. They shot a ridiculous amount of 3s and shot like over 40% on 3s.

It’s what made them a dangerous team even with them having no athleticism. But this year they’ve completely changed for some reason, they barely shoot 3s and it just makes absolutely no sense.

They’re just as bad defensively as they’ve always been, so their only chance is to get hot from 3 and win a shootout.",StrivingProsperity,2023-03-17 01:17:25

"Who cares if they're better than Princeton, that's rather irrelevant.  They ain't playing Arizona.  

Shooting well from 3 against Patriot League opponents is a whole lot different than shooting well against a P5 team with length and athleticism, especially one that is game planning to take away your looks.  They're going against very good perimeter defenders in Carr, Hunter, Rice, Brock, Arterio, Allen.

Texas also doesn't need the 3 to win as they've proven against B12-level competition.",[deleted],2023-03-16 23:31:54
