"I always forget how dumb 8/9 games frequently are. If you're an 8/9 seeded team, you definitionally are a strong team - because you're well above the bubble - but have clear flaws - because you're not even close to a top seed.

Which means both teams will go back and forth making runs then making mistakes. Take an excerpt of the best 5 minutes of each team throughout the game and they'll look like they should be favored against the 1 seed. Take the worst 5 minutes, and they'll look worse than Rutgers.",stoppedcaring0,2023-03-16 17:03:45

There are so many fouls and some of them seem very weak. I'm worried if the refs were told to call mostly everything physical. This won't look well for very physical teams the next few days.
