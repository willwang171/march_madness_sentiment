I've also got an uncle that's a retired F-16 pilot.  So I'm probably generally more curious than the average person about people in one of the service branches.

Getting to retirement is pretty impressive, regardless of branch.  From what I know it's a lot more common to do one or two rounds and get out.  I applaud your service.  Enlisting in '01 puts you just a couple years older than me, given your year(s) at IUPUI.  It also puts you signing up either right before or right after a very significant event in US history, although CG probably didn't see quite the same bump as the other branches, I'm sure it, too, had a surge of enlistment.",Where0Meets15,2023-03-17 23:26:01
