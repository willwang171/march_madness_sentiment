If not for that hot start from the Musketeers, Kennesaw could be up double digits. Xavier was scoring at will in the opening 5-6 minutes but after that the Owls were better team in the first 20.

Terrell Burden the best player in that opening half with 10 points constantly getting to the cup and scoring. Youngblood and Rodgers each have 8 with two triples including that ridiculous 3 Rodgers made at the shot clock buzzer.

In this study, the authors analyzed NCAA men's basketball games from the 2007-2008 through 2011-2012 seasons and examined how the rankings of the teams involved in the game influenced the behavior of referees. The study found that in close games, referees tended to call fewer fouls on the higher-ranked team, which suggests that there may be some bias in favor of the higher-ranked teams.",polynomials,2023-03-17 18:58:02

You sure about that? That was almost as bad for Kennesaw as the UC Nevada like choke job Mick pulled a while back 😂,x3man2018,2023-03-17 19:33:46
Why exactly? I'm not on Xavier's side or anything I just don't know much about it other than the brawls they've had.,SaintArkweather,2023-03-17 17:58:58

What kinda Chaos bracket did you have going on lol,canadianbroncos,2023-03-17 19:04:56
"Yeh I also picked upsets, but my 12 over a 5 not working out isn't what fucks up my bracket lol.

Put respect on Kennesaw State. They'd kick your ass as well,brady11,2023-03-17 17:31:36
The explanation made it worse agreed. I hate that guy. Like dude just admit it could have easily been called a foul.,jeezum_crow,2023-03-17 19:05:16

"Still hurt. Pain 7 out of 10, apparently. He says he's playing Saturday, but if he does he will be far from healthy.

My one gripe with Sampson is his preference to have a really short rotation. Injuries happen and all a sudden you're having to play guys who've barely played all year. Also feels like this is the second year in a row we have run out of gas around tourney time.",booger_dick,2023-03-17 18:36:14

"They love to claim Cincinnati, but aren't in Cincinnati. Rich private school east coast kids who didn't get in Notre Dame. And UC is just flat our the better school in pretty much any area. 

And their entire highlights of their basketball program is when they beat us. It's funny because when you go look at the ""notable games"" of the UC/X rivalry, they're always X wins, because when we win it's not notable lol",Common-Community-550,2023-03-17 18:03:45

Y'all won back to back CFPs including a 62-7 beat down. You gotta accept the basketball trash talk. It's not like you're Nebraska that doesn't have the other sport to fall back on,SaintArkweather,2023-03-17 17:47:29

"Lol Michigan isn’t even a blue blood in basketball or anything and they still blow Xavier’s program out of the water in every single aspect.* Xavier has literally never accomplished anything significant. Ever. Congrats. 

Quite the case of Napoleon complex we’ve got here lol

*Except NIt championships…you got us there 😂",jimnantzstie,2023-03-17 22:43:49

"That’s not what you asked. You asked me to find a screenshot with the Xavier player having both hands on the ball and you’d pay up $100. I did, and you didn’t. That’s fine.

"Imagine having never been to a final four. Couldn’t be me. 

Honest question is that regular season win over Michigan Xavier’s best win ever? I’m sure it is because they’ve never even been to a final four. 70 years of D1 basketball and 0 final fours is a next level of incompetence lmao.",jimnantzstie,2023-03-18 04:44:39

Here’s the thing. You know Michigan is in Ann Arbor and plays at the Chrysler Center. No one knows where Xavier is and the name of whatever bannerless irrelevant arena Xavier plays in 😂

Only programs who’ve never done shit in the tournament being up regular season wins. So this checks out.",jimnantzstie,2023-03-18 11:34:05
