We have 4 top 75 guys who could be added next year (obviously seems at least 3 of them will be on the active roster) and I think we have at least one spot for a transfer (thought Taine was gonna transfer but for some reason Tony starting playing him) so the future shouldn't suck.,Best_Duck9118,2023-03-17 05:48:58

Expected value of taking the free throws is twice as high though as it isn’t all or nothing.,NWnats14,2023-03-16 17:28:16
"The average number of points from fouling is higher though. 0.7x0.3x0.3x(3c1)x1 + 0.7x0.7x0.3x(3c2)x2 + 0.7x0.7x0.7x(3c3)x3 = 2.1

Vs 0.35x3 = 1.05 from 3

So they are slightly less likely to get 3 but they are going to average double the points.",Vegetable_Talk1891,2023-03-16 17:29:16

"This is funny. Lumping WVA and UVA together. UVA with best acc record over the last 6 years and a natty in 2019. You also are leaving Ty Jerome out of that equation and he was arguably the most important player on that team. We are frequently in the top 25 offensive efficiency. I guarantee you we run more set action on offense than 90% of teams out there. Just because you play good D and take shots later in the clock so scores are lower doesn’t mean you don’t play offense well. 

If you don’t watch the hoos and don’t understand the system don’t comment on them. We have produced Joe harris, Malcolm brogdon, Hunter, Gill, mamadi, Jerome, trey Murphy, Hauser…the list goes on. Awesome offensive weapons. 

With that said we had a down year this year (still won the acc) and just made the dumbest play in March history and outside of 2019 you could argue Tony can’t coach in March. But the overall plan and system is fantastic and successful on both ends.",Massive-Vacation5119,2023-03-16 19:43:45

Cool man, you work with some coaches. Good for you. If UVA’s system is so simple why do they often rank top 25 in offensive efficiency and have the best record in the acc in the last 6 years? I responded because it was funny to read two people who don’t know much about uva comment on them and group them in with WVA which makes no sense. 

Uva has plenty of flaws particularly this year, you just didn’t seem to understand what they were. Im not going to pretend to intimately understand why Ohio State sucked this year. Im sure you know better than me.",Massive-Vacation5119,2023-03-16 20:32:32
