I agree. You need to keep your best players in during the key moments of the game. It’s more important to keep them involved than sit them and completely Jack the entire game up.,Hooper1054,2023-03-18 03:14:54

I’ve always thought the same thing but been in the minority,ZeGreat5,2023-03-18 03:52:19
"I've always thought about this. Feels like a fallacy to keep him out. The theory is you want him for ""crunch time"" but if you have your best guy out you might be too far behind come crunch time, or if you keep him in you might have built a good lead by the time he fouls out.",SaintArkweather,2023-03-18 03:52:25

because the Memphis initiates the contact and their push was much more egregious. if the ref calls a double tech that tells memphis that they can start shoving as long as they get a reaction. which is “what to avoid when mitigating” 101,RustyKarma076,2023-03-18 03:07:34

"I understand that, human error and all that. It doesn’t make it any less shit for the team or the fans. If you break it down that way most bad calls don’t seem bad, it doesn’t change the fact that they were still bad calls. Got multiple refs out there, one of them should be looking for a TO in that situation.

Edit: to add, yes we benefited from calls too. Refs will never be good. I can complain about a game losing call and I don’t think I’m out of line. If it was y’all in that situation your fans would be saying the same stuff, let us freak out now literally right after it happened so we can come to terms with it later.



And to add to that, maybe that’s exactly why this shit should be reviewable. They HAVE to make a call and you are right with everything you said so why not baby proof it and let that be reviewed in the final minute so it doesn’t decide games.
