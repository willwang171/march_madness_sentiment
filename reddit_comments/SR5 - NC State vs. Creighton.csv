"Nobody else really showed up today except for Baby T and Morsell. But I blame this more on coach even tho Joiner had some opportunities.

"Rivalry ribbing is good for the sport so all good there. I wasn't in this thread during the game so I don't know quite how it got but I assume on the Creighton end it was some of the usual suspects. That is a complaint I have of the Creighton fan base too so I definitely can't say that it's never Creighton's fault lol

I don't really fit the mold of a lot of Creighton's fans or students though (and I didn't attend Creighton for college) so for me I just simply root for the team I grew up watching.",WON95sr,2023-03-18 00:16:41

"I mean online and in person is completely different. I know more than a few Creighton fans IRL, and all of them are good dudes. But whether it’s here to Twitter or wherever, I will honestly say I think CU has some of the worst online fans around

I’ve been to plenty of Creighton games in my life, and I’ve absolutely had some awful experiences, but 99% of the people I meet are just fine. But online… oof",FreezersAndWeezers,2023-03-18 00:24:05

"Well first of all, he misspoke, pretty obvious there

Secondly, even if he said they were on a plantation, does not imply anyone is a slave.

Third, this take is like 3 years old and just a really sad grasp at being relevant.",HooHooHaHa,2023-03-17 22:06:36
You replied to a state fan that was saying they were joining unc in hating your school. Try to learn to read and go to hell Carolina,ajpilot88,2023-03-17 22:02:17

Oh that's right. It was so long ago I forgot. Just like NC State's last championship.,EasyBreecy,2023-03-17 22:12:09
Oh that’s right you literally have not won in any sport I didn’t say anything about football we’ve won plenty in other sports too,alan_11,2023-03-17 22:43:37

Alright I see you're also uneducated about basketball. Game thread is over go drink some moonshine and chew some tobacco.,EasyBreecy,2023-03-17 22:17:16
