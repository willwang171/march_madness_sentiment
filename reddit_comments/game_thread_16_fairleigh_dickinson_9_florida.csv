Shot terribly from 3pt line , botched some easy layups, and haven't been getting to the line a ton (which is one of the statistical areas they're considerably better then FAU). Could be some positive regression in 2H as they took some quality shots inside. Also taking better care of the ball.

Keys for FAU: Stop settling for awful looks. Need to use size more to their advantage and beat FDU inside. Keep playing disciplined defense and avoid shooting fouls as they have.

Therefor, the majority of students come from South Florida, Palm Beach and Broward counties to be exact. Myself, I came from Tampa. We’re seeing more and more students from Tampa and Orlando than ever before.

We are a VERY young school. Only have had upperclassmen for a few decades now. And in relation to other Florida schools, we are on the smaller side. UCF, UF, FSU, and even FIU have nearly double the student population we do.",Jwhidde4,2023-03-20 00:24:25

>Men on average are taller, stronger, faster, better athletically.

God, I'm really taking the bait on a stupid topic here, aren't I? But NBA players are stronger, faster, and more athletic than college students. The appeal of March Madness has to do with way more than just that for me -- loyalty to the school, the sheer number of teams, the high production value. I'd watch Collegiate Rocket League religiously if it had as rabid of a fanbase.

I think a better analogy is this: I don't give a flying fuck about football. I tune out football ads; I think they're obnoxious and over the top. Yet, it's still marketed to me all the time. College basketball announcers even bring up schools' football teams from time to time! At least I *like* watching basketball.
