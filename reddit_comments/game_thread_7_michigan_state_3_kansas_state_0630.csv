"Halftime Breakdown 

- Both teams are shooting super good from 3, I think we should expect some regression on both sides.

* [](#f/michiganstate) Michigan State - Thanks to President John A. Hannah’s efforts in the 50s and 60s, Michigan State’s East Lansing campus is home to the largest residence hall system in the United States - with not 1, not 2, but **23** undergrad halls (along with a grad hall and 3 apartment villages)! Ironically, a slim majority of students actually live *off-campus*, however.

* [](#f/kansasstate) Kansas State - As a “[State] State” school, KSU is unsurprisingly a land-grant university.

We need to dig deep and find that inner strength that makes us Spartans.

We know we're the better team out there. We just need to show it in the second half. We need to play smarter, faster, and more aggressive than we did in the first half. We need to communicate more effectively on defense and make sure we're executing on offense. We need to trust each other and stay together as a team.

Remember, Spartans never give up. We fight until the end. And that's exactly what we're going to do tonight. Let's go out there in the second half and leave everything on the court. We've got this!",tag_me,2023-03-23 23:31:47

"Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we face the Wildcats of Kansas State. I gotta tell ya, I'm not really sure what a wildcat is. I mean, is it a cat that's particularly wild or something? Anyway. we all know they put their pants on just like we do, one leg at a time. But the difference is, our green and white pants are bigger, stronger, and just plain better. Tonight we're gonna take those Wildcats to school, and teach them a lesson in Spartan toughness. We'll give them a little taste of January February Izzo, and make them wish they had stayed back in Kansas. So bring your best, K-State, because our boys are locked and loaded and ready to go.

">I gotta tell ya, I'm not really sure what a wildcat is. I mean, is it a cat that's particularly wild or something?

The **wildcat** is a [species complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_complex) comprising two [small wild cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felinae) [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species): the [European wildcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wildcat) (*Felis silvestris*) and the [African wildcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wildcat) (*F. lybica*). The European wildcat inhabits [forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest) in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia) and the [Caucasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus), while the African wildcat inhabits semi-[arid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid) landscapes and [steppes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe) in [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa), the [Arabian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula), [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia), into western [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) and western [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat#cite_note-catsg-2) The wildcat species differ in fur pattern, tail, and size: the European wildcat has long fur and a bushy tail with a rounded tip; the smaller African wildcat is more faintly striped, has short sandy-gray fur and a tapering tail; the [Asiatic wildcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_wildcat) (*F. lybica ornata*) is spotted.

Ok that’s my whole point here.  I don’t get how msu/Izzo wins.  It’s black magic to me.  I see mid level talent and nothing from the coaches in the game.  The typical “grind” narrative didn’t even hold tonight: they gave up 90 pts.  I guess it’s like the SF Giants in baseball: it’s unexplainable.,Wanno1,2023-03-24 03:21:59

"There’s a lot more to coaching than just the in-game stuff too. There’s a reason past players are still involved in the program. He’s built a culture in the program over the last 28 years. That commenter clearly hasn’t watched very much MSU basketball if he’s calling what Izzo has done “black magic”. Toughness, rebounding, and effort wins games.

"You’re just trolling now. Making the adjustment to put Akins on Nowell in the 2nd half was something he did. Put us in position to win the game. He drew up a great play for Tyson to go downhill to his left hand to send the game to OT. He drew up plays to get AJ going downhill and shoot over Nowell in the lane which almost won us the game. It’s not just a fluke that Izzo has won as many games as he’s won.

He obviously drew up a play to get Tyson or Joey a look to send the game to a 2nd OT as well but they just didn’t execute.",Timely-Shine,2023-03-24 17:36:38
