You’re still thinking they hit 3-4 of these and then they’d be up but 5-7. This teams shooting is insane. It’s all layups and threes so far. USU is getting everything they want. Just have to make shots.,AccomplishedRainbow1,2023-03-16 18:38:08
Their process has been so good. Missed shots but they’ve gotten a lot of what they want.,AccomplishedRainbow1,2023-03-16 19:36:56
I just got back from class and got the game on about 5 minutes ago so tbh haven’t seen what happened before,JarodR747,2023-03-16 18:21:54
"They’re pissed because they go out of control on shots looking for fouls. Watch the game, that’s been half the calls, and why they were in the bonus with 10 minutes in the 1H",[deleted],2023-03-16 19:33:53
Must’ve missed the first half lol,bigdog782,2023-03-16 19:32:18
It was ridiculously imbalanced in Utah State’s favor in the first half.,bigdog782,2023-03-16 19:32:48

I mean according to the seeding. It would be a 10-7 upset,under_cooked_onions,2023-03-16 17:59:39
Yeah it started working. Something was just being fucky I guess.,Highest_Koality,2023-03-16 19:16:13
with at LEAST two of them being complete phantom calls,[deleted],2023-03-16 18:13:48
Thanks... looks like Mizzou watched the tape.,the_greasy_one,2023-03-16 19:20:27
Mizzou seems to always shoot well when it matters,[deleted],2023-03-16 19:27:04
Very true,530josh,2023-03-16 19:35:40
Agreed,[deleted],2023-03-16 20:46:52
is that when we went to the elite 8?,RiceTongs,2023-03-16 19:33:13

I...still don't know how that makes you have a non faded first flair.,zenverak,2023-03-16 19:23:57
"Again, that metric has nothing to do with the mountain west. We don’t control how good the teams in the conference are, how tough they schedule non conference, or the outcomes of the games. All of you act like a single game is a good metric on a teams season when in reality MM is highly matchup dependent. 

Also I’m not disagreeing with you that the MWC underperformed in MM the last 5 years just that we don’t have any control over who gets in and it’s silly to blame our teams when the selection committee is the one deciding who gets in.",lazergator,2023-03-16 21:02:02
Very talented. Multiple dudes who can carry the team in scoring. Big athletic guy who can shoot it deep. They’re a bad matchup for a lot of teams,Hooper1054,2023-03-16 19:56:54
Utah St’s strengths this season play directly into Mizzou’s weaknesses. They just ate shit today.,StinCrm,2023-03-16 19:48:08
Bro this guy chose violence. I was trying to pay a compliment ffs.,deanopeez,2023-03-16 19:51:23
Well you still got a convincing win in the first round,SeekerSpock32,2023-03-16 21:43:05
Nah man. They have 40 points in the paint. If they shoot 25-30% from 3 Utah state is golden.,AccomplishedRainbow1,2023-03-16 19:35:59
fair play.,superworriedspursfan,2023-03-16 19:47:49
Our best dude has also been in foul trouble almost the entire half and the rest of our dudes are afraid to do anything lest they suffer the same fate.,Ih8Hondas,2023-03-16 18:46:35
I would agree if similar calls were being made on both sides. But they aren't.,GankMiddleLane6,2023-03-16 18:49:13
"But the aggressive D is also why your 0 and 11 on threes. You're pretending the one thing is not linked to the other

And even then they were calling some pretty bullshit fouls early",[deleted],2023-03-16 18:52:01
They weren’t getting anything they wanted until the whistles started coming. They are also fortunate to only be down four. They have had as much good luck as bad luck,[deleted],2023-03-16 18:41:29
"To be fair, yes I did.",SeekerSpock32,2023-03-16 19:34:29

can i be so honest i have no idea how to do that and that sounds like work,lil_kitch519,2023-03-16 19:24:48
It is absolutely the teams job to schedule non conference opponents. The MW has found a loophole and keeping teams who play tough schedules out.,[deleted],2023-03-16 22:09:19
you mean Mizzou ate shit or you mean Utah State just stunk it up? Personally I think it was a good win by Mizzou but I get what you are saying.,superworriedspursfan,2023-03-16 19:50:33
Because he fouled. That’s the game my man,Arcticturn,2023-03-16 18:49:19
"Oh it definitely plays a part in how bad we are shooting. But it’s only Part of the reason we are 0/11. We’ve had some open looks, we just aren’t hitting. It’s working on keeping us from shooting well, at the cost of fouls",Arcticturn,2023-03-16 18:54:51
"Utah St is 13/17 on 2’s. Mostly layups. They’re outplaying them, just have to finish these shots.",AccomplishedRainbow1,2023-03-16 18:42:41

Yet you have it.. lol,zenverak,2023-03-16 19:26:11
You mean like…we did? We had a top 20 SOS in noncon. You can hate the net all you want but most other statistical ranking systems are pretty close to it.,lazergator,2023-03-16 22:11:50

"Refs aren't infallible. That's humanity, my man.",Ih8Hondas,2023-03-16 21:03:12
They net put 4 MW teams in bc of the way they wiggles around it. All of them lost except one who should have lost to CoC lol. Argue whatever you want the net is putting bad MW teams in that don’t belong. The last 5 years it’s pretty apparent,[deleted],2023-03-16 23:05:08
fair. I'm just glad we made it to the second round for once. MIZ! I really like our coach.,superworriedspursfan,2023-03-16 19:58:10
Flair up or shut up. You sound like a sore loser arguing “the rules on how we select teams aren’t fair you your conference does a good job working within those rules to get to the tournament” Charleston was no even close to winning. They were down 4 with like 13 seconds.,lazergator,2023-03-16 23:29:04
That’s pretty damn close lmao. Enjoy your entire conference win in 5 years. It doesn’t bother me tbh. I enjoy watching it go down. It’s like watching uga play Hawaii in football in a bowl game,[deleted],2023-03-16 23:50:04
2 possessions down is close with 13 second against one of the top defenses in the country?Gonna have to disagree there. Flair up or shut up.,lazergator,2023-03-17 00:07:03
Yes that is close lmao. Top defense in the country beat a 12 seed by 6? Top defense bc you play on the MW lol,[deleted],2023-03-17 00:19:47
Flair up or shut up. You reek of salt and have no idea what you’re talking about.,lazergator,2023-03-17 00:33:24
My team is unc. I don’t care to take the time to flair up. Not that big of a deal. I have plenty of information on what I’m talking about. And as you can see yourself. The MW is a fraud conference who won their first game in 5 years barely vs a 12 seed lmao,[deleted],2023-03-17 00:53:28
Yep there’s the salt that your team couldn’t even make the tournament. Every single basketball statistic agrees we have a very highly rated defense. Our offense however is garbage.,lazergator,2023-03-17 00:59:30
Another MW down lmao. There’s no salt we’ve been to 3 FF out of the last 6.,[deleted],2023-03-17 01:57:51
"So the mountain west teams that were equal or lower than the other seed, lost? Unsurprised. Did I miss something where the mountain west collectively declared it was better than the rest of the world at basketball? I genuinely don’t understand why you care.",lazergator,2023-03-17 02:15:10
Bc teams who play real in conferences didn’t get in this year in place of a fake conference,[deleted],2023-03-17 02:16:16
Go cry about it. This isn’t the acc tournament or the big 10. It’s the ncaa and you don’t have a say in who gets in or not,lazergator,2023-03-17 02:23:51
But we’re right. Your conference isn’t good and loses every year. Why keep putting those teams in lol,[deleted],2023-03-17 02:43:40
