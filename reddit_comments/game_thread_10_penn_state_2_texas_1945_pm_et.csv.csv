Like Texas is right now?,libsoutherner,2023-03-19 00:40:01
Crazy how you guys have two of the most hyped QB prospects in the last decade in the same QB room. It will work itself out.,Bri83oct,2023-03-19 01:21:06

Naw he’s one of the good ones don’t mind him,Cookie-Brown,2023-03-19 01:19:03

Nah.  Funk has been leaning / careening / super deep on all his shots,mbh223,2023-03-19 01:11:22
Not really. Dread hit both of his open looks. Lindy missed one. All of Funk's attempts he had a defender on him,brokedown_kayak1867,2023-03-19 01:12:03

Didn't even apply because it wasn't even an option but good try. I'll say it to your face next time instead of behind a screen like I do to all alums/non-alum fanboys. 😘,[deleted],2023-03-19 10:17:43

"Ahhhh my bad.

Although I'm not sure how much that game was effected by Self's absence, Kansas has looked mortal all year and Arkansas has the horses to compete.",[deleted],2023-03-19 02:06:12

He can hit those regularly. I watched it eviscerate my team.",OleRockTheGoodAg,2023-03-19 01:12:10
"True, but we’ve been blown out in losses, not close games. 

In games decided by five points or fewer, Kansas is 117-51 under Self. That means if you wiped out all of the others games in his career, Self would rank 77th all time among college basketball coaches in win percentage in just those games.",lawrence_uber_alles,2023-03-19 02:08:23
"Damn, third time was not a charm.",Wiggletons,2023-03-19 05:19:51
My man. If you won the game you would be happier with how things turned out. How is this hard?,JohnWickStuntDouble,2023-03-19 08:16:00
