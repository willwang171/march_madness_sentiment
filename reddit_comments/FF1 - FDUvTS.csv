"Halftime score (45 x 29 = 1305) History:

In 1305, William Wallace, Scottish rebel leader and knight, is captured by English troops, and is transported to London. The judgement, like the trial, is a formality, and Wallace is condemned for treason and for atrocities against civilians in war. After the trial, he is dragged through the streets of Smithfield and executed on August 23. Wallace is hanged, drawn and quartered – strangled by hanging – but cut down while still alive, emasculated, disemboweled (with his bowels burned before him), beheaded, and then cut into four parts. Wallace's head is placed on a spike above the London Bridge, and his limbs are displayed separately, in Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling, and Perth.",EddieSincere,2023-03-15 23:39:45

"Normally I am defensive of the smaller schools against people who only watch power conference games or the NBA and shit on these games, but I don’t think we’re going to be in for a very good game here.  


Fairleigh Dickinson’s defense ranks 361st on KenPom. There are 363 teams in D1. KenPom adjusts for tempo and strength of schedule, meaning the system believes FDU’s defense is literally the third worst defense in the entire nation. Worse than 3-26 Long Island, 5-26 South Carolina State, or 3-29 Green Bay. The next-worst ranked tournament team this year is ranked 237th, over 120 spots above FDU. In terms of the difference between their efficiency margins, second-worst Southeast Missouri State’s defense is closer in quality to *thirty two* other teams, including Miami, Marquette, and Baylor, than it is to FDU.",SaintArkweather,2023-03-15 21:46:12

"So the biggest misunderstanding with NBA defenses is that it's generally too quick for most people to follow. Even bad NBA players shoot absurdly well compared to college players, to say nothing of true super stars like LeBron, Curry, Dame etc. Therefore a lot of NBA defense is about pushing players off their favorite or ""best shot"" towards their 2nd or 3rd best shot because percentage-wise that will add up over the course of an NBA game given the total amount of possessions compared to the average college game.

The NBA is all about edge case percentages (at least the good NBA teams are). College ball is much more limited in terms of consistent talent so coaching schemes matter more.",ThatDeleuzeGuy,2023-03-16 00:45:23
