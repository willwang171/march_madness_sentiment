I think early in games opponents face guard and scheme for him.  Then at the half they see that he has 5pts and Clowney/JQ/Chuck are beating them bad.  So they switch to a more traditional D and Brandon comes alive.,overblown,2023-03-16 19:54:23

No I know they can win without Miller. But it's that combined with both Clowney and Bediako in heavy foul trouble. Any of those alone are easy for Alabama to overcome.,Pookapotamus,2023-03-16 20:57:40
