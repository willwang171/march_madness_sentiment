"The teams were known as ""The Drakes"" until 1908, when John L. Griffith, the newly appointed football coach, brought English Bulldogs to the sidelines of games, prompting Des Moines Register sports editor Art Gordon to dub the teams ""the Bulldogs"". Drake's current live mascot, Griff, is named for Griffith as a result.

Griffith was later instrumental in another major component of Drake athletics when he organized the first Drake Relays in 1910. The Relays moved to Drake Stadium when it opened in 1925.

He served as the first commissioner of the Big Ten Conference from 1922 until his death in 1944.",CTeam19,2023-03-18 01:51:03

Like I have money on Drake but why would the average Joe want Miami to lose? They’re not Duke,[deleted],2023-03-18 01:30:04
that’s makes sense lol i was like damn they sent that accidentally AND got the other team wrong,donny_diahreah,2023-03-18 00:06:30

True but one is another underseeded ACC team and the other two play mid major schedules. Look at the 4’s and 3’s. The statistical models are too heavily biased by the early non con in my opinion. The ACC is down but still a solid conference comparatively.,mitchlats22,2023-03-18 02:12:58
"Yeah, a bit. At both DeVries guys. It was clear early on that Tucker didn’t have it. But letting him go 1-11 is insane, especially with a couple wide open air balls. Stop. Shooting. Calhoun was 4-5 from 3 and you keep letting Tucker shoot instead? Mind blowingly stupid on both Darian and Tucker’s part.",MrPresident79,2023-03-19 00:17:29

They were pretty chatty until the end,elbenji,2023-03-18 01:40:40
Individual fouls is killing Drake not team fouls which they have been doing all game smh,GoochAdvocate,2023-03-18 01:39:44
Drake is playing so physical on defense these refs could call a foul every possession if they wanted. Sometimes teams shoot a lot of foul shots because they get fouled a lot.,Doubledeputy45,2023-03-18 01:40:07
You’re a Iowa state fan. It’s ok,whysocerea1,2023-03-18 01:42:16

I missed that game 😅,Incompl,2023-03-18 01:49:39
I haven't been watching the whole game but it really does look like y'all really aren't playing as a team and more like everybody just doing their own thing,OutrageousNews2555,2023-03-18 01:53:49

"People are ignoring the fact that drake was intentionally playing extremely physical D. I wouldnt be surprised if their coach legit instructed them to ""make them earn it from the line"" and it was very effective. All people see are box scores and not the game.",LastPhoton,2023-03-18 02:16:08

Yeah. I need to get a Drake shirt. My 92 year old grandpa who is an alumni and my 90 year old grandma just made a comment about me still wearing my Iowa State shirt....off to Raygun.,CTeam19,2023-03-18 01:39:36
"As one other said, residual football hate. Or they wish they had our weather, one or the other.

Yeah but it was deserved after our awful loss to FSU. Had we not lost that then I wouldve argued for something like a 3 seed.,LastPhoton,2023-03-18 02:17:37
Ok but I don’t want him to take a new job…,Scoli85,2023-03-19 00:23:25
I don't think anyone is thrilled with this performance lol.  Wong played like absolute dogshit and if he does that on Sunday we lose 100%.,ICaseyHearMeRoar,2023-03-18 02:11:00
Not saying the refs are on Miamis side just that it’s a pretty tough argument to say they’re somehow on Drake’s,FireVanGorder,2023-03-18 01:42:51
At the same time Drake turned the ball over 5 times and airballed every shot,elbenji,2023-03-18 02:26:21
It’s kinda crazy he apparently was some “undercover Canes fan” trying to use reverse luck or some weird thing,noah3093,2023-03-20 04:34:02

I’m gonna just assume lack of knowledge. And laziness. Lots and lots of laziness.,ryancubs,2023-03-18 00:57:25
Yea. Not our ordinary offense. Frustrating to watch. Credit to Drake. They’re good.,joaquinsaiddomin8,2023-03-18 02:09:10
