Unfortunately correct,jaw28,2023-03-17 00:09:49
Definitely an uphill battle even with Shaver.  Without just seems futile unless Degenhart can somehow open things up and draw some double teams so Rice can get a few open 3s off.,rattlerden,2023-03-17 00:33:11

I mean then maybe those bids should go to other major conferences middle of the road teams. I would take OSU over Boise. The MW has shown nothing over the last 5 years to deserve 3 at large bids.,ekimtk,2023-03-17 01:28:55
Already counted this one. But I’m sure we’ll be forced to see 20 next year.,8686tjd,2023-03-17 01:31:50
Is it so bright you gotta wear shades?,horseydeucey,2023-03-17 01:45:03

Utah State definitely should've. Nevada is debateable.,Jcoch27,2023-03-17 01:35:20
BIG10 is 2-1 today in closely seeded games. MD won an 8/9 game and NU just won a 7/10. Iowa lost an 8-9. We haven't even had our higher seeds play like Purdue or IU. What do you mean 'look who's talkin' as if the BIG10 is shitting the bed.,ekimtk,2023-03-17 01:34:30

But how is that the mountain wests fault? It’s the selection committee saying these teams deserve at large bids.,lazergator,2023-03-17 01:37:05
Of course it’s the committees fault. Nevada shouldn’t have even been a first four out this year,Icy_Increase3376,2023-03-17 01:37:06

"Dang nepotism smdh head 

JK. it’d be hard to root for MWC teams over the last few years",WeUsedToBeGood,2023-03-16 23:45:30
I'm not blaming the MW. I'm just saying they don't deserve as many bids and the committee needs to realize that a similar record in the MW =/= a similar record in the Big Ten/BIG12/BigEast/SEC. It's that simple. I don't know why the committee is high on giving the MW 3 at large bids. They really should be a 2 bid league based on prior performance.,ekimtk,2023-03-17 01:52:14
I don’t entirely agree that they should have been excluded but completely see the argument for excluding them.,lazergator,2023-03-17 01:38:13

"'This year has been better' I don't understand why people say this. The BIG10 has the 3rd best record by win % in the NCAA tournament since 1985. We don't have a ton of championships to show for it, but we win more games than we lose by a large margin.

"I mean our 2021 team by your logic should have maintained the expected 2 seed which would be ludicrous cause we lost the guys that made that team special.
