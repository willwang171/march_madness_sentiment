Here is the offense

Nowell brings it up

4 guys with hands on hips/knees slowly walking up the court or standing still.

at most, one guy pretends to set a screen, he doesnt, so nowell or the secondary ball handler isnt freed up at all. if that isnt run, they just spread out and hope nowell can beat his guy or hit a step back. if they get the board, nowell will drive and kick to another guy who will miss a open jumper.

* [](#f/fau) FAU - Though their football program is extremely young (have only begun playing in 2001), the small list of coaches is impressive, ranging from inaugural coach Howard Schnellenberger (of Miami Dolphins and Louisville fame), and more recently, Lane Kiffin (of USC, Tennessee, and Joey Freshwater fame)!

* [](#f/kansasstate) Kansas State - Much of the Wildcats’ success in football can be contributed to the “Wizard of Manhattan” - Bill Snyder! Hired for stints of 1989-2005 and 2009-2018, Snyder turned what was once a meandering program into a team worthy of respect, with feats like 2 conference championships, 4 division championships, 9 bowl victories, and 13 Top 25 finishes!

* **Bonus**: Why *is* Manhattan called that? Well, the OG Manhattan was named after an anglicized Lenape term for “the place where we gather [wood for] bows”, but as for the K-State Manhattan…it was named that by the New England Emigrant Aid Company (after a change of thought from the original name of “Hartford”), a group of emigrants from the Northeast who intended to make money *and* influence politics by getting people to move to the newly-stated Kansas to make it a free state!",Zloggt,2023-03-25 23:51:15
"*Pretty  even first half. What FAU is giving away on TOs (12 vs 7) they’re  making up with offensive rebounds (7 vs 3), and dominating boards  overall (22 vs 9).  Whomever fixes their glaring issue first - TOs vs Rebs - will likely have advantage in second half*

"This is a weird take.  If you're gonna be a higher seed and have trouble losing to lower seeds then the problem is not with the lower seeds but with your team.  When you get past the first weekend it is because all the teams are good enough to have gotten past the first weekend.  If you weren't playing against a higher seed then you'd be playing against an equally tough team.

You issue is not with getting beat by lower seeds but just getting beat  prior to where you think the team should have achieved. 

KU fans would know because we have had a history of getting knocked out by higher seeds at times when we were rated to go much further in the tourney (I don't count this year because I thought we were the weakest 1 seed and did not have the consistent talent/bench to make a run).",srslyomgwtf,2023-03-25 23:26:08

K-State simply needed Johnson to come up big for them to play their best. Not blaming Johnson- if anything credit FAU for keeping his involvement limited.

I see your point. Definitely could have been called as there was a lot of contact but you have to expect contact when driving at the basket like that. Ultimately I think the refs were mostly focused on if Golden's arm hit the ball or Nowell's arm so I can understand why it was called as it was.

"And yet, it's obvious you *don't watch the game*. The idea that you would watch Denver play Golden State and feel like these two teams are playing *anything* like each other is an obvious tell. I don't need to get into a basketball reference debate over it. Same goes for Milwaukee, Memphis, Miami, Boston, Minnesota, OKC, Philly. That's just off the top of my head! 

Yes, the three point shot is a necessary part of being competitive, nearly every has to rely on it. It is the center of gravity for the game, but that doesn't homogenize style or tactics. Even there, getting a three-pointer off ""as fast as possible"" is definitely not desirable for each team because - like in college - some teams play far better at faster pace, aren't good on the offensive glass, etc. whereas others create opportunities through their paint penetration. The scheming to get open shots requires personnel-dependent creativity because NBA defenses have become incredibly sophisticated (and please don't give me the ""NBA doesn't play defense"" tired line). 

> NBA basketball is a bastardization 

This is where I know I'm arguing with someone's heart, not their head. The level of play in the NBA right now is *insane*, the ball movement, the off ball movement, it's beautiful if you love the game.

"IMO, under the Gary Pinkel years, Mizzou would have won the Big 12 North many more times if they hadn't joined the SEC. The main success is in terms of the money and recruiting. Clearly our coach hasn't done well enough so we actually look worse in the SEC. I hope that changes. 

You are right though, we haven't had too much success in the SEC (at least we won the SEC East a couple of times). I still feel like we would have won the Big 12 north and possibly the Big 12 under the Lincoln Riley years. OU and Texas without Bob Stoops and Mack Brown seemed a lot worse and Mizzou was always there. 

I do wonder that, but we mostly left because we knew OU and Texas treated the Big 12 like trash. Honestly, we should have just kept it like the Big 8 from before, but Mizzou fans like me got pretty mad when we expanded so now we like to rub it in the Big 12's face.

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we somehow are still in the SEC (even if we are currently the new vanderbilt), because they really don't play around when it comes to money. Hopefully eventually the results will follow that.",superworriedspursfan,2023-03-26 12:53:27
