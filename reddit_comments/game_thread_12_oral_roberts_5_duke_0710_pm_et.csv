"If anyone needs a reason to actually root for Duke,  here are some of the ORU rules in the student handbook

-	Certain behaviors are expressly prohibited in Scripture and therefore should be avoided by members of the University community. They include theft, lying, dishonesty, gossip, slander, backbiting, profanity, vulgarity (including crude language), sexual promiscuity (including adultery, any homosexual behavior, premarital sex), drunkenness, immodesty of dress and occult practices… Students who disobey these University rules are subject to automatic suspension
-	No skateboards shall be used or balls thrown in the areas of the residence halls… Scooters, roller skates and roller blades are not permitted anywhere on University property. Water balloons and devices to project water balloons are strictly prohibited on campus.
-	Profanity is strictly prohibited. Its use subjects the student to disciplinary action.
-	The ORU administration recognizes that opinions vary among Christians as to the propriety of social dancing. However, the following official University policy has been established: social dancing is not permitted on campus…
-	Students engaging in any behavior that is considered unhealthy or that could potentially harm their person or that of another, are subject to disciplinary action and possible suspension from the University.
-	The University will not officially sponsor activities that may endanger the lives of its students. High-risk activities, such as canoeing, float trips, river rafting, water skiing, rock climbing, cliff diving, hang gliding, bungee jumping, spelunking and mountain climbing/hiking are prohibited.",LoyalAndBold,2023-03-17 00:31:44

-	Fired 3 professors for their criticism of the school being involved in the local mayoral election. 
-	The president’s wife is also accused of spending $39,000 of the school’s money on personal items like clothes. Also alleged to run up her cell phone bill to over $800 a month ([(source)](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3706360)

"A lot of things tbh. For one, rookie NCAAT coaches typically do poorly. For another, Duke is one of the poorer 5 seeds according to Kenpom/Barttorvik (in order they’d be St. Mary’s, SDSU, Duke, and then Miami) and Oral Roberts was the highest ranked 12 seed by AP (27th as opposed to VCU’s 30th, Charleston’s 33rd and Drake’s 34th). I’m aware that the AP had Duke ranked 12th and KenPom/Barttorvik don’t like ORU as much (they prefer VCU/Drake), but the perception of ORU being a good 12 and Duke being a liable 5 was there. And then Abmas. The ORU Sweet 16 run is still fresh in everyone’s mind, especially since Abmas is still at ORU. Combine that with Duke not being in the AP Top 25 for most of the year so we’ve not been on everyone’s mind as much as usual this season.

Obviously it didn’t work out that way, but I can really understand what everyone saw in ORU.",Comit22,2023-03-17 01:02:27

"10 losses… for the 5th year in a row… REMEMBER IT, WRITE IT DOWN, TAKE A PICTURE!!!",PopDukesBruh,2023-03-17 00:46:50
"it’s a probably a lot of that. he probably loves coach, loves the school, the community, etc",trex_189,2023-03-17 01:36:41
All calling us bad does is makes last year more embarrassing for y’all I’m so sorry 🫶,Licit_x64,2023-03-17 00:47:54
"Maybe so. I just think that Max's story should be a cautionary tale. There needs to be sincere discussion about players moving up, like in the Euro leagues. If you're a great player, go to the major programs, and you'll be seen more. My personal opinion. I don't have loyalty to any of these schools, though. I went to an NAIA school and didn't even play sports. So, my opinion is biased.",southpawFA,2023-03-17 01:42:45
You are correct bro… you are sorry,PopDukesBruh,2023-03-17 00:49:18
I look forward to revisiting this when y’all get bounced. See you then.,Licit_x64,2023-03-17 00:51:28
😂 what time do y’all play?,PopDukesBruh,2023-03-17 00:52:07
Proving my point “at least we made the tournament” is just a weaker “at least we beat duke in the final four”,Licit_x64,2023-03-17 00:53:31
You have the same amount of points as your team does post season games guy. Go to sleep😂,PopDukesBruh,2023-03-17 00:54:36
Hang your “we made the postseason” banner when y’all lose where we can see it 😝,Licit_x64,2023-03-17 00:57:02
"Hang your fastest #1 to unranked, and your first preseason #1 to ever miss the tourney. You’re a bigger joke than that garbage ass UNC team man.",PopDukesBruh,2023-03-17 00:58:23
"Cling to whatever you can, at least we can admit this season was a disappointment. I need the pills you’re taking that make you pretend last year wasn’t a complete embarrassment and a failure, more so now that 4/5 of the team that beat y’all turned out to be fraudulent 😭 y’all will have as many national championships as us by the end of the season n that’s a fact",Licit_x64,2023-03-17 01:04:50
"Let’s watch the next UNC game at your house, be sure to set a reminder…",PopDukesBruh,2023-03-17 01:06:03
You dodging what I’m saying now too 😭 just say I’m right and move on little bro. You can have your solace in us having a bad season but keep pretending you’re all that it’ll only make dukes inevitable L even funnier hahahaha,Licit_x64,2023-03-17 01:09:08
Set a reminder clown… otherwise you’ll forget cause it’s gonna be a long long time,PopDukesBruh,2023-03-17 01:16:46
"Your top prospect was paralyzed by nerves against ORU, what will happen against a better team? Only time will tell I suppose.",Licit_x64,2023-03-17 01:19:23
That was a long 2 days,Licit_x64,2023-03-18 21:01:42
How many points will yalls top prospect have total in the tourney? We don’t have to wait for that one.😂,PopDukesBruh,2023-03-17 01:22:47
Two long days till what…till y’all bums played… since the last time y’all played Duke won an ACC championship. Go to sleep,PopDukesBruh,2023-03-19 02:16:16
I got you here bragging about the goofiest things bro 😭 come back when you have something real to flex,Licit_x64,2023-03-17 01:47:46
You’re definitely hammered rn bruh ☠️ I respect the shit talk though. Better to talk shit and be wrong then to not talk shit at all.,Licit_x64,2023-03-19 02:20:39
Better to watch your team win the ACC championship then to watch them lose in the ACC tournament and not play again that year,PopDukesBruh,2023-03-19 11:58:38
Y’all got blown out by Tennessee and the acc is getting clapped this year in the tournament. Shame you couldn’t play like an acc champion 😆,Licit_x64,2023-03-19 19:58:48
