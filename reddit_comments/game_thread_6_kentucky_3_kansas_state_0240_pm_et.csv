For the kids raised in the nosebleeds of Rupp who are adults now looking at those same seats with banners hanging over em hoping to add one more.

The moonshiners in the mountains that can feel the roars of the crowd at Rupp all the way to their distilleries in the hills. Taking a sip of shine for the sons of kentucky.

Coach Chaney’s ability to coach hard, yet build trust and teach life lessons, is unmatched in our profession, in my opinion. Although we were competitors, it’s what I admired most about him.

Coach Chaney and I fought every game we competed – as everyone knows, sometimes literally – but in the end he was my friend. Throughout my career, we would talk about basketball and life. I will miss those talks and I will my friend. Rest in peace, Coach!”",F______________F,2023-03-19 19:29:33
