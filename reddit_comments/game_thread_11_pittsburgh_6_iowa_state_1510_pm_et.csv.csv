"The thing is, I'm pretty sure the defense is doing exactly what Otz wants. ISU is doing fantastically at suffocating Pit for 25 seconds.

But ISU's defense has always been predicated on turning the ball over, because we really don't have rim protection. No turnovers = open looks at the end of the clock, either via layups or kickouts for 3.

I'm just very confused that Otz doesn't seem to have a plan B for the offense. These guys are the ~150th ranked defense! How can you not generate *anything* against them??",stoppedcaring0,2023-03-17 20:01:15

"One of weirdest things about our fanbase is that they fall so in love so fast with the head coach, and immediately blame somebody else as soon as things go wrong. 

In football, it is always the offensive coordinator's fault: I still remember when the dastardly Courtney Messingham was the one holding back the great and noble Paul Rhoads, and now Tom Manning is gone so of course, ISU can return to dominance in football. 

In basketball, it is always the current players' fault. Steve Prohm just needed to get ""his guys"" to be successful, and now, Omaha Biliew will be the one next year to prevent the team from showing up completely dead on arrival at the start of games 5 or 6 times a season.  Because obviously that is not a coaching issue.

I expect Pitt will come out much calmer after halftime, when they have some time to cool off and maybe get coached on how to handle the pressure. The game is likely going to come down to whether ISU can force Pitt back in to making mistakes after that.",stoppedcaring0,2023-03-17 20:51:39

"Right, so WVU beating Pitt on Pitt’s home floor by 25, even worse than they beat Mount Saint Mary’s a few days prior, didn’t happen because it was the first week of the season. And it was a point of the year where WVU was playing pretty bad. Started conference play 0-5. Only beat Stony Brook by 11. Struggled against other objectively terrible teams. Looked good against Florida, but Florida turned out to be bad. And still beat Pitt by 25 on their home floor. 

Pitt is hot garbage who got unbelievably lucky today beating a team all 360+ Division 1 basketball teams would have beaten today. Enjoy losing by a bunch to Xavier.",[deleted],2023-03-17 22:07:13
