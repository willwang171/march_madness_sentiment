"Well...this game is likely staying out of hand. So why not make some light of some fun facts about these universities?

* [](#f/nevada) Nevada - Due to a large number of Basques (an ethnic group native to Spain and France known for speaking a language predating modern Indo-European languages) that emigrated to Northern Nevada, the University of Nevada has open a center dedicated to Basque studies - and of the *Euskara* language as well!

* [](#f/arizonastate) Arizona State - The famous mascot, Sparky the Sun Devil, was designed by former Disney animator Berk Anthony - and although never *confirmed*, there are many rumors that the design (especially the earlier styles) had...taken some features from Mr. Anthony's old boss Walt...

* **BONUS**: Although Arizona State has made the Tournament relatively constantly during recent times - the last they *didn't* have to first play in Dayton? **2014**. This means that, for three straight appearances, Arizona State has had the bubble work out in their favor - albeit with them still stuck in the First Four!",Zloggt,2023-03-16 03:08:35

"Obviously the standards for UCLA and Nevada and much different.

But I tell everyone. Imagine if Nevada made three Sweet Sixteens in 7 years. That’s bonkers in my eyes I would sign up for that instantly no questions asked.

I agree that maybe anticipating being able to plow over opponents at the FT line is maybe not the best strategy. But considering the season that Nevada came into, I would rather coach play to the players and assets he has rather than try and play a system that doesn’t work.

Alford in my eyes has done a wonderful job this season. If Nevada loses those three games early in the season, is the reception any different?

I’m not happy with how they finished, make no mistake, and I think coaching absolutely plays a role in it. But for me to write off Alford and this team, I just feel like that’s silly. 

Making the NCAA is an excellent season in any given year. With no seniors, I expect this team to take another step forward next year.",Freakydeaky9,2023-03-16 02:39:52

The story the local beat writer is that Nevada would have had no case on the logo but could have probably won to keep the wolf pack one word but wasn't willing to spend the money for lawyers over something so trivial. So yes big school bullies small school.,kneesmyon,2023-03-16 02:42:08
