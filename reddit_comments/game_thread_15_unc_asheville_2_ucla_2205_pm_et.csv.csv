"Okay, looks like he'll be available if needed. Don't really like the way he's carrying his shoulder but he's moving it. Hopefully we won't need him much if at all.",GrouchyTrousers,2023-03-17 01:53:19
"Bailey is arguably a better perimeter defender. Jamie actually has the best defensive win share in the pac12. Tyger and Singleton have 4+ years of experience. 

Not saying losing Clark doesn't hurt. But it really doesn't hurt as much when half the team is dpoy worthy.",AALen,2023-03-17 03:11:11
Didn't you lose your best defender? Maybe it was PTSD from Hunter going down before our UMBC loss but stranger things have happened. March is crazy anyway,daswassup13,2023-03-17 02:32:48

"I'd recommend trying something new. A lot of times the stuff you're used to, you are so used to the exact flavor (like something your mom makes) that everything else feels worse in comparison. Look for flavor combinations that surprise you. If anyone can make them taste good, it's these guys. And if you don't like it from them, you probably never will. I used to hate mushrooms, but I hate an 18 course meal from Alinea that was all about mushrooms. I still don't like mushrooms usually, but I loved that meal.",versusChou,2023-03-17 02:52:09

"I also don't drink, so it was a lot cheaper. I went in 2018 I think? It was $270 per person. Almost double if you got the drink pairings. I did the cheaper meal. They had an 18 course and 22 course option. 

So good!

And yep. Rocky was alternated between two of us. We were Big South Mascot of the year two years running   

I worked with all our athletic teams. So during basketball games I setup our kid zone. Where parents could drop their kids off and they could play. And I would work lights and instant replay at our women’s games. Baseball I would travel with the team and tally the pitch types and speed. At home games I was in charge of the walkout music, scoreboard and announcing. 

Actually I was downtown promoting our team when I met my future owner and ended up working and managing at his bar and restaurant for many many years.  Scully’s/Mountain Madre.  I’m sure you know of that place. LoL.
