"That's a charge. If the defensive player has position (he did) and the offensive player's force is enough to send the defensive player to the ground (it was), then it's a charge. The defensive player didn't launch himself off the ground or anything.

Sure, the defender went limp, but that doesn't negate a charge.",weeweeeweeee,2023-03-17 17:44:33
