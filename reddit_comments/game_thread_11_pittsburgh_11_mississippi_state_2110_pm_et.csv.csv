"Want to impress your (potential) watch party friends? Well, share them a fun fact about each of these universities!

* [](#f/pittsburgh) Pittsburgh: Located on their Oakland-neighborhood campus is the Cathedral of Learning, a Gothic-styled academic building that, at 535 ft of height, is the tallest educational building in the entire Western Hemisphere!

* [](#f/mississippistate) Mississippi State: Ever wondered where all the ""CLANGA CLANGA"" comes from? Well, back in the 1900s, there was a dairy cow that disrupted a Miss State football game by walking on the field - subsequently, the then-Aggies managed to win. Therefore, the cow began to be a symbol of good luck for Miss State fans - and overtime, the cow's bell eventually established itself as a signature of MSU fans (even after spending decades banned by the SEC)

* **BONUS**: Tomorrow night will see the women's Miss State team take on the Illinois Fighting Illini ~~who shouldn't have even been considered for the play-in~~ as part of the recently-introduced First Four games for the women (since 2022) - which means that Mississippi State is the *first* (and currently only) program with *both* the men and women playing in the play-ins in the same season!",Zloggt,2023-03-15 02:42:33

Primary defender is allowed to slide sideways or backwards to mirror the ballhandler’s movement. The defender who drew the charge was sliding sideways and the defender who got tagged with the block was *mostly* sliding sideways but also had just a little bit of forward translation. Probably no more than 10 degrees from parallel but just enough to turn what might have been a charge into a block.",stripes361,2023-03-15 02:55:33

He should be locked up in the federal reserve,3EEBZ,2023-03-15 03:14:29
"It’s such a testament to their defense, rebounding, and post play that they’re in the tournament considering they have such an inability to make 3s",marquardt_,2023-03-15 03:34:01
"Idk.  I'm sure they'll try something, but they should have known this was coming from the get-go.  Our offense isn't exactly a secret. 
 Hinson takes 9 threes per games in ACC play and has only taken 1.  We aren't forcing the 3 so far, we're just open.  I'm loving what I'm seeing on offense (do NOT ask me about defensive rebounding)",realclean,2023-03-15 02:37:53

I’m saving this for when big 12 lays an egg round 1,Lovelylives,2023-03-15 01:54:54
Sounds like he needs a ban then.,meishku07,2023-03-15 02:21:40

Yeah can't be doing that as a coach,RiverShenismydad,2023-03-15 01:30:17
Yeah I wasn’t sure either. And I’m not positive. He was supposed to be a game time decision today so maybe? But really unsure,blue_boy_24,2023-03-15 02:35:51

Flair up bitch,Lovelylives,2023-03-15 01:46:44
Miami’s not good huh? Ken Pom is a joke. Acc champ Miami surges to final 4 beating 1 seed Houston 2 seed Texas 4 seed Indiana. Acc is the supreme conference.,Lovelylives,2023-03-27 01:47:33
