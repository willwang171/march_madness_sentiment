"His in-game management has always absolutely sucked.  He’s super stubborn and doesn’t make adjustments.  

*You’re not getting calls generally on the inside and they’re blitzing ballo on the weak side, but you keep forcing it and have no counter

*on high/low action they double Ballo and leave Zu wide open from 15 and he won’t take it, but still keep running it.  

*Ballo is having a hard time passing out with his broken hand and you keep feeding into his double

*You don’t get the perimeter guys any looks until late in the game and they’re all out rhythm.

*Kriisa is having a brutal game but you leave him in for a guy in Boz who can solve a lot of your offensive problems

You’re telling me a 20 year assistant who’s now a major coach making $3.5m a year doesn’t have some counters to what Princeton was doing?  A gimmick off a timeout? A brief lineup switch to get some spacing with a small lineup.  Shoot some 3s to try to get Ramey or Kerr hot?  Nope just a shitty continuity offense that didn’t matter because they weren’t getting calls off the ball screens.  Zu was never getting his quick hitters on the baseline either.  That was pretty much it along with feeding the Ballo black hole.

I really hope they have some kind of consultant relationship somewhere to analyze Tommy’s in-game performance.  It’s unacceptable.",Wanno1,2023-03-17 03:33:39

"**The Story of Bear Down**

In 1926, Arizona's battle cry was created by John ""Button"" Salmon.  Salmon was the student body president, starting quarterback for the football team, catcher for the baseball team, a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity, and Chain Gang Junior Honorary. The day after the first game of the 1926 football season, Salmon and two others were involved in an automobile accident, in which their vehicle flipped over in a ravine. Salmon suffered a severe spinal cord injury. Football coach Pop McKale visited Salmon regularly while he was in the hospital. During McKale's last visit, Salmon's last message to his teammates was, ""Tell them... tell the team to bear down."" John Salmon died on October 18, 1926.
