It's life. These are just that. Kids. We made the dance, got fucked by NCAA officials, got to the 32 round. We've shown glimpses of greatness, and the fans have rallied. Next year and the following, we need to come strong to show the love and support for this program. It's okay. We far surpassed expectations. We weren't even supposed to dance this year.

"I'm zen... Weirdly completely relaxed now that Alabama is running away with it. I went in expecting a loss, and now that we're getting there I can relax. These refs were horseshit buried in dogshit, but I'm glad I can accept being outplayed. If we were to lose by 3 or 4 I'd be pissed because the refs may have legitimately cost the game with the shit fouls on Juju early. Instead I can remind myself this was supposed to be a rebuilding year, and it's incredible we not only made the tourney but win a game in it.
