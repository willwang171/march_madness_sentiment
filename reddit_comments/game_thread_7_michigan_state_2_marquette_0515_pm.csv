"Here are my thoughts about MSU at the half:

Michigan State University is a public land-grant research university in East Lansing, Michigan. It was founded in 1855 as the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the first of its kind in the United States. After the introduction of the Morrill Act in 1862, the state designated the college a land-grant institution in 1863, making it the first of the land-grant colleges in the United States. The college became coeducational in 1870. In 1955, the state officially made the college a university, and the current name, Michigan State University, was adopted in 1964. Today, Michigan State has the largest undergraduate enrollment among Michigan's colleges and universities and approximately 634,300 living alums worldwide.",1Bourbon1Scotch1Cash,2023-03-19 22:25:02

Only 3 of the last 10 NCAA Tournament Champs won their conference tournament (Kansas last year, Nova in 2018, and Louisville in 2013).

On top of that I looked at the last 10 winners of each of the 6 Power conferences, here's how all 60 of them faired

13 went down in both The 1st Round and The Sweet 16

12 went down in Round 2

9 went down in The Elite 8

8 went down in The Final Four

2 Lost the title game

"Not actually all that accurate. 

In 1999, 2000, and 2001 we were a one seed and made it to the final four each year, winning it all in 2000. 

2009 and 2019 we were a 2 seed and made the final four both times, losing in the national title game to UNC in 2009. Five of Izzo’s 8 final fours come as top 2 seeds. He’s only made 3 final fours as a 5 seed or lower.

The final countdown by journey starts playing over the loudspeakers. One by one each player grabs a soup ladle and spoons some into a cup. They drink.

"Hahaha you’re hilarious. Have you not watched professional sports since it became standard to have a former official in the booth to help with replays/rules? Unless it is 100% completely obvious that the call on the field/court was wrong, they will always side with the official. 


I want to be very clear: I’m not really blaming the on court officials for missing it. That’s as close of a goaltending call as I’ve ever seen. Truly bang-bang. However, there is a replay where you can clearly see the ball change direction (hit glass) before his hand makes contact. It was not a good no-call. It is an understandable one, but not good. 


In-booth officials have a duty to promote the sport. Gene used to work with these officials. He’s not going to go on TV and criticize them and say they are wrong if he doesn’t have to. He won’t keep his job. The NCAA wouldn’t let CBS just shit on its product, and in turn, CBS wouldn’t let Gene do it even if he wanted to, which he doesn’t. So be careful where you place your trust.",Sandstorm-,2023-03-19 23:39:54
