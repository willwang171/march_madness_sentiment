University administration revived the tradition in 1985, and now Auburn students can spend a whole day where they will put on name tags - and say hey to whom ever they pass by!

* [](#f/houston) Houston - UH students partake in a yearly Frontier Fiesta during every spring semester (the last weekend of March to the first weekend of April), where many people and groups hosts shows, concerts, cookouts, and other such fun things!

"No, but they make immense standards exceptions for athletes. Even elite D3 schools with terrible athletic programs will relax expectations/standards for varsity athlete recruits. 

To be clear, it doesn't mean everyone on an Ivy League sports team is a moron, but it does mean they are not all elite students. It's not like the University just admits a bunch of 4.0s with perfect SATs and then tries to assemble a basketball team.

Your 7 foot promising star really did alot in the tournament let me tell you. Your moronic fan base should be the last people talking.,Beatdooown,2023-03-19 01:17:26
I had Houston a 2 last year. Year before last was 2021 when Baylor won and Houston made Final Four. I mandela'd myself into thinking that Final Four wasn't that year. So uh my bad dawg. Covid ruined the timelime,verdenvidia,2023-03-19 00:19:27

Lol seriously. Thank god FDU and FAU won bc Memphis vs Purdue woulda been a pick your poison type of game i fear,inshamblesx,2023-03-18 23:42:36

"Yeah I watched a few games and personally thought the Big12 teams I am familiar with were better overall and your center was good but an island that could be isolated and beat. I guess I was right. Saying that I had Kansas would win it all and felt they were a better team than Arkansas. I am a Big12 fan though and excited for my team to join Big12.

Oh I never liked us as a 1 but thought we might be a top 5 team if healthy.",Luckytxn_1959,2023-03-19 00:46:53
