"Adtime Funtime: So...another crazy game at the Garden! But ads again? Bleh...may as take some time to read these fun facts!

* [](#f/fau) Florida Atlantic - The *specific* type of Owl that the ""FAU Owls"" name refers to is that of the burrowing owl, a species that is native to the Boca Raton era. To add on, these owls were commonly found in the area where the campus is located on - and still remained in good numbers even *after* FAU's construction! Eventually, an arraignment was made to make the campus an owl sanctuary - and was the eventual namesake of the university's athletic teams 

* [](#f/tennessee) Tennessee - The Vols' all-too famous mascot is Smokey the Bluetick Coonhound - but what are his origins? Well, back in 1953, there was a competition held by the university to select a live coonhound to be their mascot - and a certain Rev. W. C. ""Bill"" Brooks entered his prize-winning ""Brook's Blue Smokey"" in this competition. At halftime of a later football game, the judging was held - and even though Smokey was the last dog introduced, the way he reacted to the crowd saying his name (barking, then howling) managed to make him the winner - and thus, the start of a long mascot dynasty!

Mainly bc one of their players tried a show off 360 dunk as time expired when FDU stopped playing defense and let the clock run. FAU also had some benchwarmer waving goodbye as they closed out FAU. So really just bc they were dicks with how they finished out FDU,TotesMcGotes13,2023-03-24 01:59:12
"The dunk at the end was straight up punk ass shit, and their coach sort of started immediately working the refs and saying they’d be playing rugby against Tennessee immediately after the game.

I haven’t really liked FAU much this tourney, and am borderline rooting against them even against the damn Vols, but it was really just the one guy and the dunk that rubbed people the wrong way.",Tigercat01,2023-03-24 01:59:15

This is college, not NBA, meaning 40 minute game and 30 second shot clock, the margin for error is slim. It’s also an increasingly international game and probably the most played sport in the US, meaning the talent pool is crazy deep. So seeing all of these teams get shell shocked when they don’t KO a “weaker” opponent in the first half just screams arrogance.

Of course we play each team in the league twice, but then we faced NWMSU in MIAA championship game (which we won) and then we faced NWMSU again in the first or second round of the NCAA D2 tourney. That has happened a few times where we get to the tourney but then face a team we have already played twice that season.

I only specified that I get it in the first round because at that point there are so many games. Making it to the sweet 16 and elite 8 are iffy for me because at that point there’s a lot less to be played. There’s 63 games, and the ones down the stretch are worth more to me.
