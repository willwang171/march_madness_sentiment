"Gonzaga go into the locker room in front by 4.

If not for Julian Stawther, Gonzaga would be behind. He lead all scores with 16. Drew Timme pretty quiet in the first half with just 6 points and 4 rebounds. Expect him to turn it on in the 2nd half.

McMillan leads all Lopes with 11. Noah Baumann has 8 hitting two outside shots and Rayshon Harrison has run the show from point guard. GCU will have to hit more 3's in the second half and lock down on Gonzaga in the paint if they are to win this and cause a huge upset in Denver.",spierce64006,2023-03-18 00:30:50
"With how terrible we started the game, I'll take a 4 point lead. 

Few is usually very good at making adjustments, I look for us to come out strong in the 2nd half.",AC_Slater77,2023-03-18 00:28:28
"Hello Gonzaga fans. I see Jamal Walker on the bench for GC. He was however suspended for 2 ncaa tournament games which he has not served. Yes, the suspension was ten years ago, but he still hasn't served it. I would alert your program and force a forfeit.

Props to GCU - you guys are bringing it. Curious to see what halftime adjustments Few makes.,toneloc206,2023-03-18 00:27:34
Can we take a second to appreciate how there is like zero neutral flairs here seeing they are all in the Purdue thread lol,brokentr0jan,2023-03-18 00:43:26
"Almost no chance they win, but Lopes Up anyways",CumAssault,2023-03-17 22:49:33

The only downside to winning would be having to listen to all of Gonzaga's naysayers for another year.,KingOfThePenguins,2023-03-18 00:09:04
The games we've lost after November have been beacuse our guards shoot 8% randomly and theirs shoot 60%.  Looking a bit like that so far.,SentientPoster,2023-03-18 00:13:09

Good first half!!,brokentr0jan,2023-03-18 00:26:15
The problem is Grand Canyon was able to get a rare 5 minute scoring drought from Gonzaga and hit a ton of mid range jumpers and they are still down. I gotta see if those same shots keep falling on tired legs.,Galumpadump,2023-03-18 00:27:19
I have paid no attention to your second half dominance but good job Gonzaga,[deleted],2023-03-18 01:05:40

GCU have settled down nicely with lay-ins from Chance McMillan and Rayshon Harrison after that rocky start. Denver pun right there.,spierce64006,2023-03-17 23:48:32
We were up 7-0 when my husband said he felt like he shouldn't cheer for the Zags. He better hope they win now if he wants to save this marriage.,RurikFuries,2023-03-17 23:59:50

Timme's lack of discipline with the ball is confounding. He's been called for what feels like dozens of travels this year for his questionable post moves but still he refuses to even attempt to tighten it up. He could be so much better with just a tiny bit of focus.,__sonder__,2023-03-18 00:32:48
