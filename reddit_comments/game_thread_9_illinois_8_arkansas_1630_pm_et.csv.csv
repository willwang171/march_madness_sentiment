"For anyone unfamiliar, here is how the rest of the game will go:

Illinois will keep playing terribly to close the half, Arkansas will be up ~16 pts at the break.

In the 2nd half, Illinois will go on a crazy run to come back. With 3 mins left, it will be a one possession score or tied.

Illinois will then make 2 or 3 of the stupidest plays you've ever seen on your life to let Arkansas pull away.

Final will be a 6-8 pt win for Arkansas",brokedown_kayak1867,2023-03-16 21:17:08

No he got fouled. But refs didn’t want to call foul. So they let play on. It was either call a walk or let it play out at that point. And they knew it shouldn’t be walk bc if you don’t call a foul before that you are under assumption defense knocked ball out.,fatguysrsneaky,2023-03-16 22:39:54

"If you do then blame Jordan on his comments today lol “notice first that they're not really pressured to make mistakes. Like every team has kind of backed off letting them into their motion, letting them into their offense, letting them get set and do all this stuff. 

But I feel it's different when you come to the SEC. Dudes are going to push up on you full court, like 6'9 wings, 6'9 guards that are going to push up on you and make you turn the ball over. 

So I feel like that's one place we have an advantage to push up full court and cause an uncomfortable feeling for them.”",SEA25389,2023-03-17 22:36:18

"He needs to get some actual shooters. Part of it is that they don't seem to run nearly as many pick and rolls as I would like but Illinois has generally only had 1 shooter on the floor at a time. You need multiple guys that cannot stretch the floor. 

If Melendez can start shooting well next year(shot looks good just missed shots this year) and Goode has looked like a very good college shooter will hopefully be healthy that will hopefully open things up a bit.
