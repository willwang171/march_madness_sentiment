Race Thompson has hands of concrete, that Kopp transition 3 was stupid as shit, same with the JHS one with a ton of time on the clock, Trayce’s fouls were BS and Miami travels without getting called every possession. Oh and we give up way too many offensive rebounds.

"Energy and focus are definitively an issue here, but the defensive game plan is just not working and arguably bad.

The entire philosophy looks like we want to pressure the ball handlers on the perimeter and let trayce play rim protector.

"I like Woodson so far but with Trayce exiting the program I have a bunch of questions that next season should be key to answering - is our low three-point attempt volume a strategy specific to this roster or is it an element of Mike Woodson's offensive philosophy? If it's the latter I have a hard time seeing him put together a roster that can replicate what the last two years have produced - Trayce is a really, really, really special player. If X gets his waiver I'd like to see Woodson really mold an offense around him including getting more wing support and shooters in general around him. Between Galloway and Bates and some improvement from Banks and Gunn and maybe Leal we should have the shooters... I love Woody personally but still very up in the air on his tenure even if I mostly like how he has handled his first two years.",BoogerSugarSovereign,2023-03-20 02:45:46

A lot of us have a ton of friends that attended both schools. I even have a good buddy from Purdue that was the biggest IU fan I’ve known, just felt obligated to go to Purdue for agriculture. 


Most of my friends from Indiana don’t have this deep-seated hatred for the cream and crimson, it’s more so a very deep competetive spirit. As much as we loved beating IU so many times over the last several years, we all deep down wanted them to be more successful in order for the rivalry to be truly competetive.

"These types of comments from Indiana flairs were ALL over our NKU game and postgame thread and Auburn game thread (but curiously, not our Auburn postgame thread... probably because we kicked the shit out of them.) You have a very obnoxious element of your fanbase on this sub.

"😂🤣😁 YEAH BUDDY []_[] Pandemonium.

Even that is probably an understatement to describe the absolute insanity that is this game. There were so many times where Indiana had a shot to take the lead late in the game, but ultimately never did as Destiny Harden's go-ahead shot with 3 seconds to go lifts the 9th-seeded Hurricanes to a 2-point win against top-seeded Indiana at Assembly Hall. Incredible.

Miami, in their first trip to the Sweet 16 since 1992, will be playing Villanova.
