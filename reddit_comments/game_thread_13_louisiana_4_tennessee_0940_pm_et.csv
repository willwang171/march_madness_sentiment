"I have nothing but respect for Barnes, but to call him ""unlucky"" isn't really 100% truthful.

He plans to win games on defense. That lends itself to playing up or down to your opponents which causes great wins and head-scratching losses.

If he wants to win a championship or even a Final Four game, he's going to have to get a team to play up to their potential and not down to their opponent. I hope to see it, but I don't know that you can teach an old dog new tricks at this point.",Frankwillie87,2023-03-17 02:33:45

Did you watch the same half of basketball I just did? Tennessee looks fucking terrible... Louisiana is 0-6 from 3 point range and shooting sub 30% from the floor and barely down double digits.

Oral Roberts would be very much in this game and possibly winning with how UT is playing.,ekimtk,2023-03-17 02:37:11
Duke is a much better team than Tennessee respectfully. They have multiple players that will play in the nba. Tenn does not. Louisiana is 0-6 from 3 point range and shooting sub 30% from the floor and only down 11 because of 5 points in the last 40 seconds from Tennessee.

"The seeding is fair just because of our early season wins (and alabama, but that was at home and healthy).

Barnes is an awesome coach. Yeah he has been unlucky in March, but he's not the one out there missing shots and throwing the ball to nobody. 

He made the tourney 16 out of 17 times at Texas. 27 times in his career. He can obviously recruit good to great players as well as develop 3stars into doggone monsters.

Oh and he's a stand up guy. He takes good basketball players and makes them great men.  So that's a big plus imo",[deleted],2023-03-17 02:35:50

It’s a Rick Barnes team in a national tournament with no point guard and over a month in a row of disappointing performances.,rhinocodon_typus,2023-03-17 03:55:07
But I would if you were next man up in the tourney even though not at full strength.  We’ve beat you and Kansas.  I consider us big 12 champs at this point.,fragger404,2023-03-17 03:11:02

"I know how that feels.
