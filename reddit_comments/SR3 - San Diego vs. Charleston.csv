"I like making fun of the Mountain West as much as anyone but I also disagree with people saying they’re “gaming the system” or that they shouldn’t get at larges.

Their teams perform well in November and December. For better or worse that’s when conferences make or break their rep until selection Sunday. They generally have pretty senior heavy teams who are ready to go day 1 but don’t have the same capacity to improve as much throughout the season is my opinion.",SwgohSpartan,2023-03-16 20:28:47

San Diego and Charleston almost having the same exact latitude is pretty sweet,footer9,2023-03-16 20:07:01
"Will Wade was a grad assistant for that staff too (although we may have dodged a bullet on that one).

I just don’t understand how Brownell consistently pulls of big upsets just to turn around and lose to horrific teams.",Wolf_of_Walmart,2023-03-16 21:48:33
Not even close on his arm. Bro swatted the ball from behind. The only case you can make is that he crowded his landing but even that’s a weak argument,jacob2815,2023-03-16 21:44:39

For sure. I don’t think it was a foul after either.,sumalumadingdng,2023-03-16 22:48:50
"There are rumors that the Pac might grab SDSU, Colorado State, and potentially Hawaii. Haven’t heard anything about them trying to grab more schools, though",[deleted],2023-03-16 19:59:08
SDSU might be going to the Pac-12,Peefs,2023-03-16 19:59:21
The rumor is San Diego St and SMU are close to joining the PAC 12 soon. Colorado St possibly as well. Boise St and Fresno might be considered by the Big 12. The Mountain West commissioner has also not ruled out expanding into the eastern time zone.,spierce64006,2023-03-16 20:10:54
"“In 1981, college basketball went away from jump balls during the game and added the possession arrow, with high schools quickly following suit. The reasoning is that the jump ball gives taller and more athletic players a clear advantage, while the arrow alternates possessions between the teams.” -Yardbarker.com",BBennison9,2023-03-18 02:36:12

You might be right. There were several questionable calls throughout the game. Nothing seemed abnormal from any other ncaa game though,jacobean___,2023-03-16 21:50:48
I think “CofC” would make more sense than Charleston in that case. That’s normally what the school and locals use.,Wolf_of_Walmart,2023-03-16 20:31:19
not arguing Rutgers should’ve made it anymore but that doesn’t mean I’m still outraged nevada got in over OSU and MW got 4 teams in general,TheScarletSeahawk,2023-03-16 20:57:08
