All due to Rick Barnes remembering he is allowed to coach in March.  They doubled Roach from the start and played aggressive D.  Seemed to really throw them off on the offensive end.  And for the life of me I can’t figure out why Duke kept running a zone in the second half when we were just tearing it apart.  They gave us 15 points before they went back to man D,fragger404,2023-03-18 22:48:05

"The NCAA definition is as follows:

>	Committee members defined flopping as an unsporting act that occurs when a player attempts to influence an official's judgment by creating an appearance that a foul has been committed when there has been incidental or no contact

But they further explain:

>When evaluating potential flopping situations, officials will be asked to judge whether the player's physical reaction to the contact with another player is consistent with what would have been expected, given the force of the contact. When the reaction is not consistent, the player is most likely exaggerating the nature of the contact in an attempt to gain an advantage, and flopping has occurred.

So it seems that there otherwise being no foul is actually necessary, so you are right. I should maybe rephrase and say that hard contact isn’t always a foul. Basketball is a contact sport.",TheVandyyMan,2023-03-18 19:14:35
