celtic ft buck find new slant
wonder harden p would dry heaving
c getting mauled hoop getting call
surprisingly good refereeing far
middleton v celtic vietnam flashback
sad honestly see myers bringing back might last season
imagine booing injury
believe rocket still tbh
harden softest eyeball clearly threw head green finger floppy neck
must scott foster fault
second round another beast would one biggest collapse long time
im coach think supposed score opponent
giannis literally stiff arm hayward surprised get ft tbh
get defensive rule buck rozier got hammered
incredibly smart niko
last game
exciting sense non stop action care either team ref stopping play yeah rocket answer problem halftime dude could still rocket game right fun see fast paced basketball
think finish shit commercial end
harden played injury whole fucking career still locker room shit dire
called charge harden first block tucker
yeah playoff warrior
dunno man look reeeal bright
disputing call good look calling ref name say player play different depending officiating human error fine essentially rewriting rule fit whomever officiating healthy game
seen adam silver play dude killer j beyond arc
officiating actually pretty decent far
something right clipper future western conference
injured month two year ago
khris middleton one ugly dude
kidding need stop potty mouth family get
animal kingdom look like awesome show never life actually watch
step
uhhh even close true celtic shot ft giannis shot buck shot total nice try though
c lol
harden red eye black dragon
assumes difference wide open shot contested shot need desire draw foul also plausible contested shot need power arc something else compared wide open shot sc argument would convincing comparing good shoot say curry durant klay among others comparing contested versus wide open shot otherwise think convincing evidence
need clipper warrior bingo card flop get marked could seed man rotation randomly card think make tommorow
attempted shortcut fucked u year
slow much course look almost intentional
shit get raunchy
celtic black band number someone die
know fact red sox around time umpire increasingly calling low pitch strike went got bunch pitcher like throw low specialize pitch break
love shit k lol guard coming nowhere block guy like ad
team huge outlier argument best defensive team ever rus seeing defense like career mostly due rule change good counterpoint though
want play compete would chance title contender
fuck scott foster literally front harden fuck shit seriously annoying
inaccurate statement
goaltend still beast play
feel guilty think feel depressed anxious money possession whatever
get better offseason might jump mid
george hill get hook missing free throw lead jr fuck one ever reference missed shot
dude shut capela grab board scott foster nothing
